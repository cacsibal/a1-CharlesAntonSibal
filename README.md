This page displays my implementation of HTML tags to represent myself and design scheme in a sleek fashion.

## Technical Achievements

### CSS Styling
- h1, h2, h3: bottom border following color scheme generated on Adobe
- li: changes color on hover following color scheme generated on Adobe, as well as padding value
- li:hover: defines the color and padding to change to on hover
- body: changed body text to Roboto flex, a publicly available font from Google
- footer: made footer content appear hovering from page

Styling the header elements were not necessarily difficult; rather, I had trouble minimizing redundancy without using classes.
I unfortunately settled on the current implementation.

Animating the list items was challenging for me because I'm newer to CSS. 
The li and li:hover style rules go in tandem, and I had trouble learning how to use both to achieve the effects I wanted.

I had initially style the fonts individually for the headers, list items, and paragraph tags.
Learning how to use fonts online rather than downloading them into the repo was not difficult but time intensive.

The footer was most difficult of all, as I wanted to make it "float" from the page. I also wanted to have all the items space themselves evenly.
This was challenging mostly like how the others were; mainly just tedious.

### JS Animations
- section: made text fade in when on screen and fade out when not in view

This was challenging because I had to learn JS. There were multiple ways to do this, as well, so finding the most efficient way was also tedious.


### Semantic HTML
- img: portrait picture of myself
- a and img: hyperlinks to my various accounts at the bottom of the page
- script: for website layout
- footer: for footer content
- section: for website layout

The img tag was not difficult to implement, rather styling it inline was tedious.

Then using images to represent hyperlinks came a bit easier, but I had not initially realized that images could do that in the first place.
I had first tried to use them as buttons.

Implementing the script tag was confusing for me at first because I had first wanted to write the logic in server.
I then figured it'd be better to separate the server logic from the frontend logic

The footer tag was challenging due to the problems I mentioned earlier.

The section tag was tedious to style correctly.

## Design Achievements
- **Used the Roboto Font from Google Fonts**: I used Roboto as the font for the text on my site.
- Color scheme: blues and purples (see screenshot)
